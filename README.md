# lords-paradox
This repository contains the analytic code to accompany the article entitled "Lord's 'paradox' explained: The 50-year warning on the use of 'change scores' in observational data". The code was initially prepared by Peter Tennant (University of Leeds) during 2022-2023 for the original ArXiv preprint (version 1). It was subsequently updated during 2023-2024 during peer-review with the American Journal of Epidemiology and again in 2025-2026 to accompany the updated ArXiv preprint (version 2).

Both versions of the code simulate data in Python using the DagSim package, which is called and executed within R using the reticulate package. In version 2, this is integrated into a R Markdown file. The code relies on several packages including DagSim (for python) and CMAverse (for R), which will need to be fully installed for the code to correctly run. We have tried to include installation lines to the code, but you may encounter various problems with established installations, particularly if your R installation is not able to set up and edit your python environment.  

Both version will create CSV and PNG files in your working directory. For further details, see the annotation at the top of the relevant file.
